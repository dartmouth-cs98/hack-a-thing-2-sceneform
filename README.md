#### What I built

I attempted to built an AR Android App where you can use your camera and move around 3D objects.
I used Sceneform for 3D rendering.

This hack-a-thing inspired me to learn more about AR as it is a new field that I have not worked in.
It was helpful in preparing projects as some of the project ideas I've thought about involve some kind of 3D manipulation.

#### What did not work

The app was not stable&broke a couple of times and I have not yet been able to detect the cause of it.
